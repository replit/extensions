  longDescription: "The Extensions API Tester runs all of the available Extension APIs including experimental ones.  If a required test fails, that usually means we broke something either in the Extensions client or on Replit's side.\n\nIf you are contributing to the [main repository](https://github.com/replit/extensions), all required tests need to pass before we merge your Pull Request.\n\nIf something is broken, please let us know by making a post on the [Ask Forum](https://ask.replit.com/c/extensions)"
